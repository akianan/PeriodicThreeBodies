# PeriodicThreeBodies
This is a repisitory containing the code and materials for my algorithm that optimizes vectors for three body systems to a quasi stable orbit.

main.py documents the algorithm which is under the function "loss_values"
NumericalSolver.py documents the fully differentiable diff eq solver, whose function is titled "torchstate". 
All code is in python and requires the pytorch, and torchdiffeq modules.
